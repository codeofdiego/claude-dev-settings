## Dependency Audit

Analyze project dependencies for security, licensing, and maintenance concerns.

### Audit Process:
1. **Dependency Mapping**: Catalog direct and transitive dependencies
2. **Security Scanning**: Identify known vulnerabilities and CVEs
3. **License Compliance**: Check for license compatibility and restrictions
4. **Maintenance Status**: Assess project health, update frequency, community support
5. **Alternative Analysis**: Evaluate lighter or more secure alternatives
6. **Update Strategy**: Plan for dependency updates and version management

### Output:
- Dependency inventory with risk assessment
- Critical security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- License compliance issues
- Outdated dependencies with update recommendations
- Dependency reduction opportunities
