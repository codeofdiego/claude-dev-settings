## Performance Audit

Analyze application performance and identify optimization opportunities.

### Audit Areas:
1. **Frontend Performance**: Bundle size, loading times, rendering efficiency
2. **Backend Performance**: Database queries, API response times, resource usage
3. **Infrastructure**: Scaling bottlenecks, caching strategies
4. **Monitoring**: Performance metrics, alerting, observability gaps
5. **User Experience**: Core Web Vitals, perceived performance

### Analysis Process:
- Profile current performance metrics
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Prioritize optimizations by impact vs effort
- Create performance improvement roadmap

### Output:
- Performance baseline assessment
- Critical performance issues
- Optimization recommendations with expected impact
- Implementation timeline and effort estimates
