## Create Refactoring Plan

Analyze code that needs refactoring and create a safe, incremental improvement plan.

### Analysis:
1. **Current State**: Document existing code structure, patterns, and technical debt
2. **Target State**: Define improved architecture and desired outcomes
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify breaking changes, dependencies, and migration challenges
4. **Incremental Steps**: Break refactoring into safe, testable phases
5. **Rollback Strategy**: Plan for reverting changes if issues arise

### Output:
- Technical debt assessment
- Phased refactoring roadmap
- Testing strategy for each phase
- Estimated effort and timeline
- Risk mitigation strategies
