## Analyze Ticket and Create Implementation Plan

You are tasked with analyzing a ticket description and creating a comprehensive implementation plan. Follow these steps:

### Analysis Process:

1. **Ticket Understanding**
   - Parse and understand the ticket description provided in the arguments
   - Identify the core problem, requirements, and acceptance criteria
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements

2. **Codebase Investigation**
   - Search the codebase to locate relevant files, functions, and components
   - Understand the current architecture and patterns
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Map out the areas of code that will need changes

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Break down the ticket into specific technical tasks
   - Identify the sequence of changes needed
   - Consider edge cases and potential complications
   - Plan for testing and validation

4. **Time Estimation**
   - Provide realistic time estimates for an average developer
   - Consider complexity, testing, code review, and potential blockers
   - Break down estimates by sub-task if applicable

5. **Task Breakdown Analysis**
   - Determine if the ticket is appropriately sized for a single implementation
   - If too large, identify logical breakpoints for independent sub-tasks
   - Ensure sub-tasks can be implemented and deployed independently
   - Prioritize sub-tasks based on dependencies and business value

### Output Format:

Provide your analysis in this structure:

**Ticket Summary**: Brief overview of what needs to be implemented

**Affected Components**: List of files/modules/systems that will be modified

**Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step technical approach

**Time Estimate**: Total estimated hours with breakdown by major tasks

**Task Breakdown**: If the ticket should be split, provide sub-ticket recommendations with individual estimates

**Risks & Considerations**: Potential blockers, dependencies, or technical challenges

**Testing Strategy**: How the changes should be validated
